# Nudge
> Without bells and whistles

### What?
Nudge is an open-source tool to broadcast Events to a website's viewers. For eg. Imagine a tourism website that offers various tour packages to different locations. The providers wish to send out promotional offers and discount notices to its viewers. With Nudge, you get to do this along with a nice little dashboard to track all such events that has run its course on your website.
Nudge also provide APIs to manage events, so its easy for you integrate this with other apps!

### Why?
I find it really hard to find a simple tool that does exactly this. I agree that there's plenty of paid options out there, which includes this tiny little feature, but what if we only need this option! So why not build one!

### Contribute
Nudge is built with Elixir's Phoenix framework and PostgreSQL.  
If you don't have Elixir installed, head over to https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
